# üîç Frypto: Feature Engineering for Financial Time Series (Crypto)

Frypto is a Python package designed to compute a set of financial time series features. ***including price-based, volume-based, volatility, momentum, trend, and statistical features.***
<!--  maybe image for before frypto after frypto. or set of generated features in a table** -->
---
## Why frypto?
- In the G-Research competition, the top 3 winners demonstrated the critical role feature engineering plays in predicting real-world crypto market data.
- **Frypto saves over 100 hours** of manual feature creation and uses memory optimization tools to handle large datasets smoothly.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üì• Install with pip

```bash
pip install frypto
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Frypto
load your CryptoCurrency data (or download data with yfinance as shown below).
```python
from frypto import AllFeatures
import yfinance as yf

# Download BTC-USD data from Yahoo Finance (or use your dataset)
data = yf.download('BTC-USD', period='max', interval='1d')

# Initialize Frypto and compute features
allfeatures = AllFeatures(data)
features = allfeatures.compute()  # Returns a pd.DataFrame with the new features

# View the top rows of the generated features
print(features.head())  # New DataFrame with 41 features

```

## Usage

Frypto computes a range of financial TS features, **price changes, spreads, rolling statistics, momentum indicators, trend indicators, volatility measures, volume-based features, and lagged features.**

- **Price and Spread Features**: `Price_change`, `next_log_return`, `high_low_spread`, `close_open_spread`
- **Volatility Features**: `rolling_std`, `upper_band`, `lower_band`, `ATR`
- **Momentum Indicators**: `RSI`, `MACD`, `Signal_Line`, `SMA`, `EMA`, `ROC`
- **Statistical Features**: `Skew_20`, `Kurtosis_20`, `ZScore_20`
- **Volume-Based Features**: `volume_change`, `OBV`
- **Lagged and Rolling Features**: `lag_1`, `lag_2`, `lag_3`, `rolling_mean`, `rolling_max`, `rolling_min` (for windows 5, 10, and 20)
- **Trend Indicators**: `+DI`, `-DI`, `ADX`, `support_line`, `resistance_line`, `tenkan_sen`, `kijun_sen`, `senkou_span_a`, `senkou_span_b`, `chikou_span`

# Download historical BTC-USD data

# Initialize and compute Price Features
price_features = PriceFeatures(close=close, high=high, low=low, open=open_)

# Initialize and compute Volatility Features with a specified window
volatility_features = VolatilityFeatures(close=close, high=high, low=low)

print("Volatility Features:\n", volatility_df.head())

# Initialize and compute Momentum Features, with specified windows for RSI and MACD
momentum_features = MomentumFeatures(close=close)
momentum_df = momentum_features.compute(window=15, rsi_window=14, macd_windows=(12, 26, 9))
print("Momentum Features:\n", momentum_df.head())

# Initialize and compute Statistical Features with a specified rolling window
statistical_features = StatisticalFeatures(close=close)
statistical_df = statistical_features.compute(window=20)
print("Statistical Features:\n", statistical_df.head())

# Initialize and compute Volume Features
volume_features = VolumeFeatures(close=close, volume=volume)
volume_df = volume_features.compute()
print("Volume Features:\n", volume_df.head())

# Initialize and compute Trend Indicators with a specified window
trend_features = TrendFeatures(close=close, high=high, low=low)
trend_df = trend_features.compute(window=15)
print("Trend Features:\n", trend_df.head())

# Initialize and compute Lagged and Rolling Statistics with specified lags and windows
lag_rolling_features = LagRollingFeatures(close=close)
lag_rolling_df = lag_rolling_features.compute(lags=[1, 2, 3], windows=[5, 10, 20])
print("Lag and Rolling Features:\n", lag_rolling_df.head())

# Combine all computed features into a single DataFrame
