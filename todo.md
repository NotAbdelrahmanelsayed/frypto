- [ ] Refactor to inherit `extract_features` from `allfeatures` in other classes, if applicable.  
- [ ] Set up Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing and checks.  
- [ ] Optimize performance:
  - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
  - Implement multiprocessing where possible to enhance computation speed.
